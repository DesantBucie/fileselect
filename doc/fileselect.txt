3. Usage					*fileselect-usage* *:Fileselect*

The command :Fileselect opens a popup menu with a list of file names in the
current directory tree. When you press <Enter> on a file name, the file is
opened. If the selected file is already opened in a window, then the cursor
will move to that window.  If the file it not present in any of the windows,
then the selected file will be opened in the current window.  You can use the
up and down arrow keys to move the currently selected entry in the popup menu.

You can also supply a directory as an argument to the :Fileselect command.

In the popup menu, you can type a series of characters to narrow down the list
of displayed file names. The characters entered so far are displayed in the
command-line. You can press backspace to erase one character from the
previously entered set of characters. The popup menu displays all the file
names containing the series of typed characters. You can press <C-U> to erase
filter text.

You can close the popup menu by pressing the escape key or by pressing CTRL-C.

In the popup menu, the following keys can be used:

    CTRL-F	- Scroll one page forward
    <PageDown>	- idem
    CTRL-B	- Scroll one page backward
    <PageUp>	- idem
    CTRL-Home	- Jump to the first entry
    CTRL-End	- Jump to the last entry
    <Up>	- Go up one entry
    <C-P>	- idem
    <Down>	- Go down one entry
    <C-N>	- idem
    <Enter>	- Open the selected file
    <Esc>	- Close the popup menu
    <CTRL-C>	- idem
    <BS>	- Erase one character from the filter text
    <C-H>	- idem
    <C-U>	- Erase the filter text

Any other alphanumeric key will be used to narrow down the list of names
displayed in the popup menu. When you type a filter string, then only the
filenames fuzzy matching the string are displayed in the popup menu.

You can create a key mapping to toggle the file select popup menu. For
example, to use <F2> to toggle the file select menu, add the following line
to your .vimrc file:
>
    nmap <F2> <Plug>Fileselect_Toggle
<
